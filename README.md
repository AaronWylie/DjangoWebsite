This is a website I built using Django web framework along with Amazon AWS services.
The url is --> www.thewirebot.com
You can try accessing it, but it might be down because I have to shut it off after I go over Amazon free data trial.
There is some screenshots also of the website in the respitory as "website screenshots"

The website was built for a senior design project at Texas A&M Univeristy.  The purpose of the project is to create a wire bot 
system (similar to NFL cameras)that uses machine learning to image plants in a greenhouse and categorize them.  The website 
displays this information for individual users.  The website uses PBKDF2 security for all users for privacy.
